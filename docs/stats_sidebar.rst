Static Calculations
-------------------

11 statistic/analysis functions are calculated using the input spectrum
or â€¨specified region of interest, depending on what is selected in the
left side bar.  If a region of interest is selected, the statistic
calculations are updated when that region of interest is changed.

Mean, median, standard deviation, max and min are calculated using
``numpy.mean``, ``numpy.median``, ``numpy.std``, ``numpy.ndarray.max``
and ``numpy.ndarray.min`` respectively. The centroid, full width half max,
and equivalent width are calculated using the
``specutils.analysis.centroid``, ``specutils.analysis.fwhm``,
``specutils.analysis.equivalent_width respectively.

The signal to noise ratio is calculated using ``specutils.analysis.sn``,
however if no uncertainties have been provided for the input spectrum, this
value will N/A.

The count total filed is calculated using ``specutils.analysis.line_flux``.
